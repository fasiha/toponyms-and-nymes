# 平等院

- [平](びょう)[等](どう)[院](いん)

A Buddhist temple in the city of Uji in Kyoto Prefecture. It is jointly a temple of the Jōdo-shū and Tendai-shū sects.

Originally built in 998 as a rural villa of high-ranking courtier Minamoto no Shigenobu, it was purchased by Fujiwara no Michinaga after its original owner’s death. The villa was made into a Buddhist temple by Fujiwara no Yorimichi in 1052. The most famous building in the temple is the Phoenix Hall ([鳳凰堂](#鳳凰堂) Hōō-dō), constructed in 1053. It is the only remaining original building, surrounded by a scenic pond; additional buildings making up the compound were burnt down during a civil war in 1336.
